Media Queries:

eg.
max-width:
    - any width that is less than the max-width specified, all of the css within the query will take affect.

so our case 
min-width: 768px
    - means if the width is at least 768px (x >= 768), then the affects will trigger. 
        
        in addition:
            - overflow: hidden; 
                -notice our mini images doesnt appear full width. perhaps that has to do with hidden. 
        


@media all and (min-width: 768px):

    .thumbnail-item {
        max-width: 260px;
    }

    .thumbnail-item + .thumbnail-item {
        margin-top: 20px;
    }

so if the min-width of the screen is 768px, the image tag should have max-width of 260px.
- wtf is .thumbnail-item + .thumbnail-item 
    - ok its inside the gallery, each image has a margin-top, to separate it.
